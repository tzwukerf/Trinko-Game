# Trinko-Game

This program lets the user play Trinko Game, a Trivia game where the user answer five questions and gets to score points depending on how many they answer correctly. My custom feature is to have a socreboard where one gets to insert their name and play against their friends and see who ends up getting the most points. I put this custom feature in a separate function called leaderboard.

Use IDLE to run trinko-game.py. Make sure to type and enter main() to start the program.

FOR CLARITY:

My code is exclusively in trinko-game.py.

The code for graphics and TrinkoTitle.gif, TrinkoTime.gif, and questions.txt are not mine.
